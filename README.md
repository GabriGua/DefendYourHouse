# DefendYourHouse
"Defend Your House!" is a game made in Javascript for the Sprig console.

**What is my game about?**

In this game you have to protect your house from the meteorogical event placing the blocks around the house. If the house get hit then you lose. You must protect your house as long as you can. In this game every block counts! So... don't waste it! This game is a mix of strategy and luck.

**How do you play my game?**

Click "Run" once you reach my game on the sprig editor:

It's pretty simple!\
Click W-A-S-D to move around the cursor.\
Click L to place a block in the white area, you can also reinforce a block placing one above another.\
Click J to start the events one by one.\
Click J once you lost to restart the scene.\
Then Click K to restart playing or during the events to restart placing blocks if you haven't placed them all!\
Place the blocks carefully,\
Survive!!!\

**Boring Information ahah**\
I'm so proud of this game, with this game I was able to learn a bit of javascript that I have never used before. I developed this game most of the time at school during some free hours and it was exciting doing it with my classmates that created their own game too. It was a beautiful experience and probably in the future I will publish some other funny game in order to play it on my sprig console.
Now I'm making a video about this opportunity (like how the platform works...) and as soon as I will publish it in my YT channel I will link it here. The video will be in italian and I hope to make some people get interested in this type of things! (That's the porpuse of the channel actually).
